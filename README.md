🌾 Indian Agriculture Sector Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing the Indian Agriculture Sector using multi-dimensional data from 2005–2023.
The aim is to understand crop production trends, state & district performance, seasonal outputs, and overall agricultural growth across India.

The dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, students, and analysts visualize large agricultural datasets in a clean and interactive format.

✨ Key Highlights

📍 33 States, 646 Districts, 122 Crops, 6 Seasons analyzed

📊 Total production trend (2005–2023)

🗺️ Interactive map showing crop distribution across India

🌾 State-wise & district-wise production breakdown

📅 Year and crop slicers for dynamic filtering

📈 Top performing states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh

🌦️ Seasonal production insights (Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Winter, Autumn, Whole Year)

🧠 Insights Discovered
🔹 State-Level Production

Kerala leads with the highest total agricultural production, followed by Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.

🔹 District-Level Patterns

Specific districts like KOLLAM, MALAPPURAM, and THIRUVANANTHAPURAM show significant contributions.

🔹 Crop-Year Trend

Production shows ups and downs, with major peak periods around 2015–2018.

🔹 Seasonal Production

Whole Year crops dominate total production (over 95%).

Seasonal crops (Kharif, Rabi, etc.) contribute smaller but important shares.
